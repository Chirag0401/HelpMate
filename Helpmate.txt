Its basic engineering is to use scientific findings to find creative, practical solutions. It is a noble profession.



1. “Design is not how it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works” – Steve Jobs (Apple co-founder and former CEO)

2. “A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering” – Freeman Dyson (theoretical physicist and mathematician)

4. “There is nothing I believe more strongly than getting young people interested in science and engineering, for a better tomorrow, for all humankind.” – Bill Nye (science educator, former mechanical engineer)

5. “Engineering stimulates the mind. Kids get bored easily. They have got to get out and get their hands dirty; make things, dismantle things, fix things. When the schools can offer that, you’ll have an engineer for life.” – Bruce Dickinson (airline pilot, musician)

6. “To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the glass is half empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.” – Unknown
